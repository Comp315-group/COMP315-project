//Someone please write this, as well as the corresponding Player.cpp file

//Player needs name, score, xPos, yPos, image, sprite, and a method to handle input like

//void handle_input(sf::Event input){
//if (input.Type == sf::Event::KeyPressed)
//{
//  if(currentEvent.Key.Code == sf::Key::Up)
//  {
//etc
